This website was built with an aim to bring together Competitive Programming and Web Development.. 

This site will help CPers perform most of the calculations and to get most of the algorithm's snippet in one place.
There is also a contact page where you can contact me or send any snippets that you want me to add.

The site is running DJANGO on the server-side and plain HTML/javascript on the client-side.

Features needed to be added
1) Login page for a personalized experience- where users can save the snippets they like or add any other snippets if they want.  
2) Note making (something like a sketchpad)
3) CP calendar
4) CP visualizer - Find your number of questions solved, types of question solved, rankings , rating changes from famous sites, etc at one place

Feel free to create any issues or add any other feature you want me to add
